Financial Risk & Revenue Analysis (SQL Project)

Overview
This project analyzes a banking dataset to evaluate:
- Loan performance
- Customer risk
- Revenue generation
- Customer behavior

 Objectives
- Calculate total bank revenue
- Identify non-performing loans (NPL)
- Build a loan approval model
- Segment customers based on value and risk
- Analyze transaction patterns

Key Analysis Performed

Revenue Analysis
- Total bank revenue  
- Revenue by branch, product type, and region  

Loan Performance
- Identification of non-performing loans (NPL)  
- Calculation of NPL ratio  
- Loan recovery rate  

Risk Analysis
- Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio calculation  
- Customer risk classification (Low, Medium, High)  

Customer Profitability
- Total profit generated per customer  
- Top 5 high-value customers  

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Revenue contribution per customer  
- Customer segmentation (High, Medium, Low value)  

Behavioural Analysis
- Deposit and withdrawal patterns  
- Net cash flow per customer  
- High activity customers  

Decision Model
- Loan approval engine based on:
  - Credit score  
  - Debt-to-income ratio  
  - Default history  

Time Analysis
- Monthly revenue trends  
- Monthly default patterns  
- Loan disbursement trends  

 Tools Used
- SQL (MySQL)

 Key Insights
- The bank generates revenue primarily from loan interest and fees  
- High debt-to-income ratio is a key indicator of risk
- A small number of customers contribute most revenue
- Certain regions show higher financial risk exposure

Problem Statement
  Banks face challenges in managing loan defaults, identifying high-risk customers, and maximizing revenue.  
  This project aims to:

  - Measure bank revenue streams  
  - Identify non-performing loans (NPL)  
  - Assess customer risk using financial indicators  
  - Analyze customer behavior and transaction patterns  
  - Build a simple loan approval model  

Dataset Description
The dataset contains banking transaction and loan-related information, including:
- Customer details (ID, name, employment status, credit score)  
- Loan data (loan amount, interest rate, repayment, default status)  
- Transaction data (deposits, withdrawals, transfers)  
- Financial indicators (monthly income, existing debt)  
- Time data (transaction date)
